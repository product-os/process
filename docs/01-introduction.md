# Introduction to processes

We use GitHub extensively at Balena, and for the time being that is more or less exclusively for source code. Some examples where we use GitHub for things other than the source code are

- the Handbook
- documentation for different products and services that we have

Processes can be documented using repos, so that we have features like version control, better collaboration than Google Docs, and more. 

This site itself is hosted in a way similar to how you can document processes!

We are going to walk through some steps that you can follow to setup a repo to document a process you are working on.

1. Configuring a website
2. Understanding the folder structure
3. Using mermaid diagrams when it makes sense
