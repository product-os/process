handle: Convert process to a diagram
type: transformer
description: Create a high level diagram of the process
actor: GitHub CI
access:
input:
  - Process simplified yaml file
output:
  - Process diagram image
instructions: "1. Using mermaid syntax, create a shape based on the element type: Skewed rectangle for an input-output, rectangle for a transformer

2. Use the 'handle' as text for the each element

3. Draw an arrow from every 'input-output' to every `transformer` that calls it as `input`

4. Draw an arrow from every 'transformer' to every `input-output` that call as `output`

5. When the diagram is finished export a PNG file

  ![Image 1 appears here](img1.jpg)

6. Save the PNG file to the repo's output folder, name it as 'process-diagram.png'"
